# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews. See the full list in the [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/123) goal.

#Well formatted code

 Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. npm run lint).
 Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors.
#Clear and readable code

 Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)
#Clear and useful README

 Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions.
#Proper dependency management

 There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. npm install) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README.
#Good project management

 Commit messages are concise and descriptive.
 Each commit has a specific scope, and does not include unrelated code.
 All features are added via pull requests.
 Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made.
 Every pull request has been reviewed with Prrr.
#Testing

 Code is sufficiently covered with a unit test suite

Classic

#makeChange

  Given a price and an amount paid, return the number of coins in each denomination that should be given as change.

  Note: because JavaScript is bad at decimal math, the inputs are given as integers that represent dollar + cent amounts, so 139 = $1.39.

  makeChange({ price: 100, amountGiven: 100 })
  // => { quarters: 0, dimes: 0, nickels: 0, pennies: 0 }

  makeChange({ price: 159, amountGiven: 200 })
  // => { quarters: 1, dimes: 1, nickels: 1, pennies: 1 }

  makeChange({ price: 432, amountGiven: 500 })
  // => { quarters: 2, dimes: 1, nickels: 1, pennies: 3 }

#fizzBuzz

  Return an array of numbers from 1 to 100.

  For multiples of three, use the string Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five replace with Buzz.

  For numbers which are multiples of both three and five replace with FizzBuzz.

  fizzBuzz()
  // => [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz', ...]

#isPalindrome

  Determine if a string is a palindrome. Return true or false.

  Ignore punctuation, spacing, and case sensitivity.

  isPalindrome('radar')
  // => true

  isPalindrome('bananas')
  // => false

  isPalindrome('A man, a plan, a canal: Panama')
  // => true

##Numeric

#factorial

  Return the factorial of a number.

  factorial(5)
  // => 120
  fibonacci

  Return an array of Fibonacci numbers to the nth position.

  fibonacci(10)
  // => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

#collatzConjecture

  Return the Collatz sequence for a given number.

  The Collatz sequence for any positive integer n is defined as follows:

  If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process until you reach 1.
  collatzConjecture(1)
  // => [1]

  collatzConjecture(7)
  // => [7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]

##Set Operations

#setUnion

  Return the union of two sets.

  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  const b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
  setUnion(a, b)
  // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

#setIntersection

  Return the intersection of two sets.

  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  const b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
  setIntersection(a, b)
  // => [2, 4]

#setCompliment

  Return the compliment of two sets.

  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  const b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
  setCompliment(a, b)
  // => [6, 8]

#setSymmetricDifference

  Return the symmetric difference of two sets.

  const a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  const b = [2, 4, 6, 8]
  setSymmetricDifference(a, b)
  // => [1, 3, 6, 8]

##Sorting and Searching

#mergeSort

  Sort an array of numbers using the merge sort algorithm.

  mergeSort([10, 2, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 1, 4, 9])
  // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#bubbleSort

  Sort an array of numbers using the bubble sort algorithm.

  bubbleSort([10, 2, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 1, 4, 9])
  // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

#binarySearch

  Search for a number within an array using the binary search algorithm.

  const numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
  binarySearch(numbers, 45)
  // => 8
  Graphing and Geometry

#closestPair

  Given a set of points on a 2-dimensional plane, return the pair of points with the least distance between them.

  Reference: Wikipedia

  const points = [
    [2,1],
    [4,0],
    [-1,0],
    [5,3],
    [-2,5],
    [3,-3],
    [-2,0],
    [3,4],
    [5,-4],
    [0,-2]
  ]
  closestPair(points)
  // => { pair: [[-1, 0], [-2, 0]], distance: 1 }

#isConnectedGraph

  Check if a graph is connected or disconnected. Return true or false.

  A graph is connected when there is a path between every pair of vertices.

  Reference: Wikipedia

  const graphA = {
    'a': ['b', 'c'],
    'b': ['a', 'd'],
    'c': ['a', 'd'],
    'd': ['b', 'c'],
  }
  isConnectedGraph(graphA)
  // => true

  const graphB = {
    'a': ['b'],
    'b': ['a'],
    'c': ['d'],
    'd': ['c'],
  }
  isConnectedGraph(graphB)
  // => false
