# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews. See the full list in the [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/123) goal.

## Installation and Setup

Cloned GitHub repository, ran npm install, gave warnings "No repository set" and "No license file", unsure of warning since repository has been set and license file exists.

## Usage and Examples

Finished implementing algorithm problems; makeChange, FizzBuzz, isPalindrome, factorial, fibonacci, collatzConjecture, setUnion, setIntersection, setCompliment, setSymmetricDifference, and mergeSort.

Finished implementing remaining algorithm problems: bubbleSort, binarySearch, closestPair, isConnectedGraph.
