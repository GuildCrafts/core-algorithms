# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews. See the full list in the [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) file.

For examples of how to test, see the [testing.md](testing.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/123) goal.
